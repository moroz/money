This is a simple, two-class gem to perform currency conversion and arithmetics using different currencies. It was written in response to a coding challenge as a part of the recruitment process at a German media agency specializing in Web design and development. It uses the Fixer.io to fetch currency exchange rates and is unit-tested using RSpec and Webmock.
